# First steps with unittest package

Trial of unittest with Python to see any advantage over pytest

## How to run the tests
```
$ python3 -m unittest <file_you_want_to_test.py>
```

## Conclusions
unittest is good for a quick demonstration or for times when importing pytest might not be possible. There was no extensive testing done but it appears that unittest could be less easy to understand for non-tech individuals
